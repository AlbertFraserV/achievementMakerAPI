# achievementMakerAPI
The API that runs and connects the database to both the Custom Achievement Maker and the GUI application (both are works in progress). See the wiki(https://github.com/AlbertFraserV/achievementMakerAPI/wiki) for usage documentation. 

The Achievement Maker will allow a user to create achievements for a video game that other users can unlock. This is an API that serves that information the encompassing application. 

For those uninitiated an "achievement" is simply a goal with any number of requirements associated with it. Once those requirements are satisifed the achievement is unlocked. There can be any number of achievements for a game. 

Some examples would be like: 
* Completing World 1-1 in Super Mario Brothers without losing a life.
* Completing a game on the hardest difficulty.
* Beating a certain score on arcade games like Galaga and Defender.
